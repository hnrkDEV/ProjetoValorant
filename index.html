Once equipped, her crosshair will be replaced with an indicator for placing the rose. This will turn blue if it is placed on a viable position to be cast in, and will turn red for unviable positions. Arc Rose can also be cast on the opposite side of viable surface by using Alternate Fire. Upon casting, the rose will travel to the location and briefly deploy, then it will turn invisible and remain at its position indefinitely.</p></div>
